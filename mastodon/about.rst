Welcome to PHP Community on Mastodon!
-------------------------------------

We provide a place for PHP programmers & friends to discuss topics
related to the PHP programming language, frameworks, packages, tools,
open source, tech, life, and more. First and foremost, we're about
building community, and that doesn't always involve technical
discussion, so feel free to go off-topic and have fun.

Who Runs This Server?
---------------------

Since this is asked often, `Ben Ramsey <https://phpc.social/@ramsey>`__
is the primary administrator of this Mastodon server, and he pays for
the server out of his own funds. If you’d like to help with costs, feel
free to contact him. His commitment to you is this:

“phpc.social is for the public benefit of the PHP community. I will
never turn it off or shut it down. I will seek help from the community
with finances and server maintenance, if either becomes an issue, and
should anything happen to me that prevents me from continuing the
service, I will have a contingency plan in place to ensure continuity.”

---------------

   *If you believe anyone is in physical danger or doing something that
   is against the law, please notify appropriate emergency services
   first by calling the relevant local authorities.*
